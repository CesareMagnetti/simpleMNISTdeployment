# simple MNIST classifier deployment with Flask and PyTorch

Small project to deploy a pytorch model on heroku, potentially allowing for user inputs.<br> 
User interface will be minimal (if any) as this is not an HTML/css project but more a project to learn about deploying ML models as web applications.<br><br>
FInal application can be found at: https://cesare-mnist-simple-app.herokuapp.com/
